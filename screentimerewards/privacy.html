                <p>Last Updated: October 28, 2025</p>

                <p>At ScreenTime Rewards, we believe your family's data belongs to you. We built our app using Apple's latest privacy-preserving technologies to ensure that we never see or store your personal usage data.</p>

                <h2>1. Screen Time Data & Privacy</h2>
                <p>Our app utilizes Apple's <strong>Screen Time API</strong> (Family Controls, Device Activity, and Managed Settings frameworks) to monitor app usage and apply restrictions.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>On-Device Processing:</strong> All calculations regarding how much time your child spends on apps happen directly on their device.</li>
                    <li><strong>No Surveillance:</strong> We (the developers) cannot see which specific apps your child is using, nor do we track their browsing history. The Apple framework hides specific app names and bundle IDs from us to protect your privacy.</li>
                    <li><strong>CloudKit Sync:</strong> Configuration data (like which apps are "Learning" vs "Reward") and usage summaries are synced between parent and child devices using your personal, private <strong>iCloud</strong> container. We do not have access to this data.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
                <p>We do not collect, sell, or share personal data. The app functions without creating a separate user account with us. Authentication is handled entirely through your Apple ID and iCloud.</p>

                <h2>3. Children's Privacy</h2>
                <p>This app is designed for use by families and children. We comply with COPPA and GDPR-K regulations by ensuring that no personally identifiable information (PII) is collected from children by our servers.</p>

                <h2>4. Subscription Data</h2>
                <p>Subscriptions are managed by Apple via the App Store. We receive anonymous receipts to validate your "Individual" or "Family" plan status, but we do not receive your payment details or billing address.</p>

                <h2>5. Account Deletion</h2>
                <p>Since we do not create user accounts on our servers, there is no account to delete with us. To remove all data:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Delete the app from your devices.</li>
                    <li>Go to iOS Settings > Apple ID > iCloud > Manage Storage, and delete the data container for ScreenTime Rewards if you wish to remove synced settings.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
